# 🏦 LLM-Driven SQL RAG Pipeline for Banking Data

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using **LangChain**, **OpenAI**, and **Streamlit** to enable natural language interaction with a structured SQL database containing synthetic banking data.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This system bridges the gap between non-technical users and financial databases by allowing users to interact with banking data using everyday language.

It works by:
- 🧠 **Converting natural language questions into SQL queries**
- 💬 **Executing those queries against a real SQLite database**
- 📊 **Returning readable, chat-style responses**
- ✍️ **Allowing safe execution of write operations with confirmation**

The data is entirely synthetic and generated using [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/), ensuring safe testing and reproducibility.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- 💡 **LLM-powered SQL generation** via LangChain + OpenAI
- 🔍 Handles both **read and write operations**
- 🖥️ **Streamlit chatbot UI** with full query and response history
- ⚙️ **Modular codebase** — extendable for new domains or databases
- 🛡️ Built-in **confirmation step for write operations**

## 🧪 How It Works

1. The user enters a question like:  
   _"Show all customers with a savings account balance over ₹10,000"_

2. The LLM (via LangChain SQLChain) translates it into SQL:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM customers
   JOIN accounts ON customers.customer_id = accounts.customer_id
   WHERE account_type = 'Savings' AND balance > 10000;
   ```

3. The system executes the SQL on the SQLite database and returns the results in a friendly format.

4. For write operations (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`), it prompts the user to confirm before executing.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- 🐍 Python 3.10+
- 🤗 LangChain
- 🧠 OpenAI GPT
- 🗃️ SQLite (via SQLAlchemy)
- 🌐 Streamlit
- 🔐 python-dotenv for API key management
- 🧪 Faker (for fake banking data generation)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/varad-suryavanshi/LLM-Driven-SQL-RAG-Pipeline-for-Banking-Data.git
cd LLM-Driven-SQL-RAG-Pipeline-for-Banking-Data
```

### 2. Set up the virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Create and populate the database

```bash
python src/database.py
python src/generate_data.py
```

### 4. Add your OpenAI API key

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### 5. Launch the chatbot interface

```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses a **synthetic banking dataset** containing:

- `customers`: names, ages, addresses
- `accounts`: types and balances
- `transactions`: amounts, dates, types (credit/debit)

The dataset is generated using Faker and stored locally in a SQLite DB (`data/bank.db`).

> The `data/` directory is excluded from the repo for cleanliness.  
> You can regenerate the full dataset anytime using `generate_data.py`.

---

## 🚧 Future Enhancements

- 🧠 Add embeddings + vector-based RAG
- 🔎 Improve SQL validation and explainability
- 🧰 Switch to PostgreSQL for enterprise-scale testing
- 🚀 Deploy on Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces
- 🔐 Add user login + query logging features
